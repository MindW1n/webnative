Framework for creating desktop (if you want to write mobile apps, I think Cordova is a good option)
applications on top of native webview component and nodejs backend

Prerequisites: g++, gtk-3.0, webkit2gtk-4.0, nodejs

How to make dist? - Just run make like this: "mindw1n@fedora:~/webnative/$ make". Makefile will do the rest.
