Framework for creating desktop (if you want to write mobile apps, I think Cordova is a good option)
applications on top of native webview component and nodejs backend

Prerequisites: g++, gtk-3.0, webkit2gtk-4.0, nodejs (Ask chat gpt how to install those)

How to make dist? - Just run make like this: "mindw1n@fedora:~/webnative/$ make". Makefile will do the rest.

How to use npm packages on the backend? - First things first, u need to install them:
cd app/api
npm init -y
--then install all the packages you need--
Then u can import them in the app/api/backend.mjs file. Ensure that u have app/api/node_modules.

How to use js frameworks? - U need to install them (now in the project root folder):
npm init -y
--then install the packages you need--
Then u can compile the code into app/public/index.js with for example babel and webpack
and connect it to the index.html
